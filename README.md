# pygame_book
This book is an introduction to game programming with Pygame, aimed at readers who want to learn how games work from the inside.

The focus is clearly on programming techniques, not on fancy graphics or visual design. Topics include animation, tile-based graphics, collision detection, state machines, sound handling, and working with larger game worlds. Each concept is introduced step by step and illustrated with small but complete example games.

Later chapters show how these techniques come together in practice, demonstrating how even simple ideas can turn into playable games.

I openly admit one thing: I am much better at programming than at creating visually stunning game art. This book reflects that. If you are interested in graphic design workflows—from sketching to polished assets—there are many excellent authors who cover that topic far better than I could.

All source code and resources used in the book are available in this repository. The examples are meant to be readable, modifiable, and reusable—feel free to experiment, break things, and build your own ideas on top of them.

Feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism are always welcome.
